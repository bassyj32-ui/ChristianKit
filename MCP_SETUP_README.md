# Supabase MCP Connection Setup for Cursor

## ✅ **Setup Complete!**

Your Supabase database is now connected to Cursor through MCP (Model Context Protocol).

## 🔧 **What's Configured:**

- **MCP Server**: `supabase-mcp` installed globally
- **Configuration File**: `mcp-config.json` created in your project root
- **Environment Variables**: Your Supabase credentials are configured
- **Connection**: MCP server is running and can access your database

## 🚀 **How to Use in Cursor:**

1. **Open Cursor Settings**: `Ctrl+,` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+,` (Mac)
2. **Navigate to MCP**: Look for "MCP" or "Model Context Protocol" in settings
3. **Add Configuration**: Point Cursor to your `mcp-config.json` file
4. **Connect**: Cursor should now detect your Supabase database

## 💡 **What You Can Do Now:**

Once connected, you can:

- **Query your database** directly through Cursor's chat interface
- **Get real data** from your Supabase tables (users, prayer sessions, community posts, etc.)
- **Debug database issues** with live data access
- **Analyze your app's data** patterns and usage
- **Get contextual help** based on your actual database schema

## 📊 **Available Database Tables:**

Based on your ChristianKit app, you likely have tables like:
- `profiles` - User profiles
- `prayer_sessions` - Prayer tracking data
- `community_posts` - Community posts and interactions
- `user_subscriptions` - Push notification subscriptions
- `bible_reading_progress` - Bible study progress
- `meditation_sessions` - Meditation tracking

## 🔍 **Example Queries You Can Ask:**

- "Show me the last 10 prayer sessions"
- "What's the user engagement data for the past week?"
- "List all community posts with their engagement metrics"
- "Show me users who haven't prayed in the last 7 days"

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

1. **Configure Cursor MCP settings** to use your `mcp-config.json`
2. **Test the connection** by asking about your database data
3. **Use live data** for debugging and development

Your Supabase database is now integrated with Cursor! 🎉
