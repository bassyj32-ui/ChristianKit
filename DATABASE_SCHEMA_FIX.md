# Database Schema Issues - FIXED ✅

## **Issues Identified and Resolved**

### **1. Missing Community Tables** ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The main Supabase setup script (`scripts/setup-supabase-db.sql`) was missing all community tables.

**Solution**: Merged all community tables from `database-setup.sql` into the main setup script.

**Added Tables**:
- `posts` - Community posts with content, categories, hashtags
- `prayers` - Comments on posts (prayer responses)
- `post_interactions` - Amen/love interactions on posts
- `hashtags` - Trending hashtags tracking
- `followers` - User following relationships
- `notifications` - User notifications system

### **2. RLS Policy Gaps** ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Community tables had no proper security policies.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive RLS policies for all community tables:

**Posts Policies**:
- Users can view all posts
- Users can create/update/delete their own posts

**Prayers Policies**:
- Users can view all prayers (comments)
- Users can create/update/delete their own prayers

**Interactions Policies**:
- Users can view all interactions
- Users can create/delete their own interactions

**Followers Policies**:
- Users can view all follower relationships
- Users can create/delete their own follows

**Notifications Policies**:
- Users can only view/update their own notifications

### **3. Foreign Key Violations** ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Posts reference `auth.users` but RLS might block access.

**Solution**: 
- All foreign keys properly reference `auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`
- RLS policies ensure proper access control
- Added proper indexes for performance
- Created triggers for automatic count updates

## **Additional Improvements Made**

### **Enhanced User Profiles**
- Added `display_name`, `handle`, `bio`, `location`, `website`
- Added social metrics: `follower_count`, `following_count`, `post_count`
- Added `is_verified` flag for future verification system

### **Automatic Count Updates**
- Triggers automatically update post counts when posts are created/deleted
- Triggers automatically update interaction counts (amens/loves)
- Triggers automatically update prayer counts (comments)
- Functions for follower/following count management

### **Performance Optimizations**
- Added GIN index for hashtags array
- Added indexes for all foreign keys
- Added indexes for commonly queried fields (created_at, category)
- Created `trending_posts` view for efficient trending calculations

### **Community Features**
- Support for post categories and hashtags
- Amen/love interaction system
- Prayer (comment) system
- Follower/following system
- Notification system
- Trending posts algorithm

## **Files Updated**

1. **`scripts/setup-supabase-db.sql`** - Main database setup script now includes all community tables
2. **`SUPABASE_DATABASE_SETUP.md`** - Updated documentation to reflect all tables
3. **`DATABASE_SCHEMA_FIX.md`** - This summary document

## **Next Steps**

1. **Run the updated setup script** in your Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Test community features** by creating posts and interactions
3. **Verify RLS policies** work correctly for different user scenarios
4. **Test foreign key relationships** and cascade deletes

## **Verification Commands**

After running the setup script, verify everything works:

```sql
-- Check all tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Check RLS is enabled
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- Check triggers exist
SELECT trigger_name, event_manipulation, event_object_table 
FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_schema = 'public';

-- Test trending posts view
SELECT * FROM trending_posts LIMIT 5;
```

## **✅ All Issues Resolved**

The database schema now includes:
- ✅ All community tables
- ✅ Proper RLS policies
- ✅ Foreign key relationships
- ✅ Performance optimizations
- ✅ Automatic count updates
- ✅ Trending posts functionality
